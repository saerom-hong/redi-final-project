# Mein Bier 🍻

This is the final project at Redi School's 2021 fall semester React Course. The goal is creating a react app that displays the top 5 german beers and searches for breweries by german federal states. It contains the concepts that we've been learning this semester including hooks, routing, local & global state management, etc.
